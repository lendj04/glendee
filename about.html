                <p>
                 
The Lux Mundi Cup at Tangub City Global College is an annual event that 
celebrates the talents of students through sports, academics, and cultural 
. The name "Lux Mundi" means "Light of the World," which reflects the college's
 goal of fostering excellence, leadership, and unity among students.
<br><br>
During the event, students compete in various sports 
(like basketball and volleyball), academic contests (such as quiz bees), and 
cultural performances (like singing and dancing). Itâ€™s a fun and exciting way for
 students to show their skills, support each other, and build a strong sense of 
 community at the college. The event also helps develop well-rounded students by 
 encouraging both academic and extracurricular achievements.
